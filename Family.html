				<h2>My Family</h2>
			
				<p> I have a wonderful family which consists of 6 members including my father, mother,
					two sisters and a brother. This photo was taken during the New Year's Eve
					of 2021 that also includes my two close cousins.
			
				<p> My father named <span>Pedro Rioflorido</span>, a senior citizen and retired employee of 
					Philippine Airlines. He worked there for almost three decades.
			
				<p> My mother named <span>Adelfa Rioflorido</span>, a hardworking, affectionate and nurturing
					mother of 4. My mother takes care of everything and everyone in the family.
			
				<p> My brother named <span>Reggie Rioflorido</span>, oldest of 4 siblings, finished his 
					degree in Computer Engineering in AMA Computer Colleges. He is the most hardworking
					sibling of all.
				
				<p> My first sister named <span>Hazel Rioflorido</span>, an Electronics Engineer who finished
					her studies at Adamson University. She is my most dedicated and joyful sibling.
			
				<p> My second sister named <span>Rachell Rioflorido</span>, a Fleet Manager who finished her
					studies and pursued a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management.
					She has a bubbly personality, one of the kindest and generous sibling.</p>
