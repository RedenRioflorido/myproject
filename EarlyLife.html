			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p> Reden Rioflorido was born in Ayala, Alabang on 12th of December 2001
				but grew up in Las Piñas City. 
				At a young age, he liked singing and he was interested in music,
				computer technology and geography science which drove him to excel at school.
			
			<p> Reden is always known as jolly and outgoing kid however, he was become a victim of bullying
			    which occured when he was in primary school. 
				The bullying followed him everywhere and he remembers walking down the halls of his school
				hearing and calling him distressing words made by his bullies that affected his performance
				in school. The results are unpleasant. He got apalling grades but that doesn't stop him from
				building himself a better version. Fast forward, Reden coped with his bullies and continues
				to believe in himself.
				
			<p> He graduated from Manuyo Elementary School in Las Piñas City in April 2014,
				and from Don Bosco High School in Parañaque City in April 2020. He continues
				his studies at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines to complete
				his bachelor's degree in BS in Information Technology.</p>
