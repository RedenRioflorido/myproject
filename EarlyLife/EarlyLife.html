<H1 ALIGN=MIDDLE>REDEN'S EARLY LIFE</H1>

<P>A SMILE IS QUITE A FUNNY THING,</BR>
IT WRINKLES UP YOUR FACE,</BR>
AND WHEN IT’S GONE, YOU NEVER FIND</BR>
ITS SECRET HIDING PLACE.</BR>

<P>BUT FAR MORE WONDERFUL IT IS</BR>
TO SEE WHAT SMILES CAN DO;</BR>
YOU SMILE AT ONE, HE SMILES AT YOU,</BR>
AND SO ONE SMILE MAKES TWO.</BR>

<P>HE SMILES AT SOMEONE SINCE YOU SMILED,</BR>
AND THEN THAT ONE SMILES BACK;</BR>
AND THAT ONE SMILES, UNTIL IN TRUTH</BR>
YOU FAIL IN KEEPING TRACK.</BR>

<P>NOW SINCE A SMILE CAN DO GREAT GOOD</BR>
BY CHEERING HEARTS OF CARE,</BR>
LET’S SMILE AND SMILE AND NOT FORGET</BR>
THAT SMILES GO EVERYWHERE!</BR>
